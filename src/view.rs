//! The retained-mode view tree: the [`View`] trait, the owning [`Group`], the
//! handler [`Context`], and the [`StaticText`] leaf (ADR 0003, 0004).
//!
//! A [`View`] knows its owner-relative [`bounds`](View::bounds), draws itself
//! through a [`Canvas`] in local coordinates (ADR 0015), and handles events. A
//! [`Group`] owns its children (`Vec<Box<dyn View>>`, parent-owns-child), draws
//! them in z-order, and runs the three-phase dispatch — *positional* (mouse →
//! the view under the cursor), *focused* (keys/commands → the focus chain), and
//! *broadcast* (everyone) — plus Tab/Shift-Tab focus traversal.
//!
//! Views never reference one another. A view emits a command by posting it to the
//! [`Context`]; commands then bubble **up** the owner chain as the recursive
//! dispatch unwinds, and broadcasts travel **down** (ADR 0003).
