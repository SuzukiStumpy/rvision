//! Input and lifecycle events, and the typed result of handling one.
//!
//! The event loop ([`crate::app`]) feeds [`Event`]s to a handler, which returns
//! an [`EventResult`] saying whether it consumed the event (ADR 0004). Unlike
//! TurboVision — which signals "handled" by mutating the event to `evNothing` —
//! we never mutate the event: consumption is a typed return value, and handlers
//! receive `&Event`, so "clear the event" is impossible by construction.
//!
//! These types are deliberately backend-agnostic: crossterm's own event types
//! never appear above the backend seam (ADR 0001, 0002). The
//! [`crate::crossterm_backend`] module translates raw crossterm input into them.
