# Module spec: `rvision::widgets` controls (Phase 5)

- **Status:** Done; `ListBox`'s scroll bar in progress (Draft) per ADR 0015
- **Phase:** 5 (Dialogs & controls); scroll-protocol migration post-extraction
- **Related ADRs:** 0003 (commands up / broadcasts down), 0004 (three-phase dispatch), 0005 (colour roles), 0008 (owner-relative coords + `Canvas`), 0010 (modal dialogs + focus-aware drawing), 0015 (scroll chrome per-view protocol), 0017 (resize propagation per-view protocol)

## Purpose

The focusable, content-bearing widgets that live **inside** a [`Window`](window.md):
`Label`, `Button`, `InputLine`, `CheckBox`, `RadioButtons`, `ListBox`/`ListViewer`,
and `ScrollBar`. Reusable, editor-agnostic. These are the counterpart to the
Phase 4 chrome furniture (`Window`, `MenuBar`, …); together with `Window` they let
an application ask the user a question.

It is **not** the modal machinery (that is [`app::exec_view`](app.md), running a
[`Window`](window.md)) and not the editor view (Phase 6).

## Focus-aware drawing (ADR 0010)

`View` gains one defaulted method:

```rust
fn set_focused(&mut self, focused: bool) { let _ = focused; }
```

The owning `Group` pushes it as focus moves (initial child on construction; old →
`false`, new → `true` on Tab); a `Group` forwards a `set_focused` it receives to
its focused child, so it composes through nesting. A control that cares stores the
flag and consults it in `draw`; everything else inherits the no-op.

## Public interface

```rust
// --- Label: descriptive text in a dialog ---
pub struct Label { bounds: Rect, text: String, style: Style }
impl Label { pub fn new(bounds: Rect, text: &str, theme: &Theme) -> Self; }   // Role::EditorText-ish
impl View for Label { /* not focusable; draws its text */ }

// --- Button: posts a command when activated ---
pub struct Button { bounds, label, command, focused, default, normal, focused_style }
impl Button {
    pub fn new(bounds: Rect, label: &str, command: Command, theme: &Theme) -> Self;
    pub fn default(self, yes: bool) -> Self;   // Enter activates it even when unfocused
    pub fn is_default(&self) -> bool;
    pub fn command(&self) -> Command;
}
impl View for Button { /* focusable; Enter/Space → post(command); draws focused/normal */ }

// --- InputLine: a one-line text field ---
pub struct InputLine { bounds, text: String, cursor: usize /*grapheme*/, scroll, focused, .. }
impl InputLine {
    pub fn new(bounds: Rect, theme: &Theme) -> Self;
    pub fn with_text(self, text: &str) -> Self;
    pub fn text(&self) -> &str;
}
impl View for InputLine { /* focusable; edits text; draws caret when focused */ }

// --- CheckBox / RadioButtons ---
pub struct CheckBox { bounds, label, checked, focused, .. }
impl CheckBox { pub fn new(bounds, label, theme) -> Self; pub fn is_checked(&self) -> bool; }
pub struct RadioButtons { bounds, labels: Vec<String>, selected: usize, focused, .. }
impl RadioButtons { pub fn new(bounds, labels, theme) -> Self; pub fn selected(&self) -> usize; }

// --- ScrollBar + ListBox ---
// A drawn position indicator (mouse drag: Phase 9). Vertical or horizontal
// (Orientation); a *host* (Window, FileDialog) draws and hit-tests one for
// whichever child reports ScrollMetrics (ADR 0015) — a ScrollBar is never
// wired directly to a specific widget type.
pub struct ScrollBar { bounds, orientation, total, visible, pos, style }
impl ScrollBar {
    pub fn new(bounds: Rect, style: Style) -> Self;            // vertical
    pub fn horizontal(bounds: Rect, style: Style) -> Self;
    pub fn with_orientation(bounds: Rect, style: Style, orientation: Orientation) -> Self;
    pub fn set_metrics(&mut self, total: usize, visible: usize, pos: usize);
}
pub struct ListBox { bounds, items: Vec<String>, selected, top, focused, .. }
impl ListBox {
    pub fn new(bounds: Rect, items: Vec<String>, theme: &Theme) -> Self;
    pub fn selected(&self) -> Option<usize>;
    pub fn selected_text(&self) -> Option<&str>;
}
impl ListBox {
    pub fn set_bounds(&mut self, bounds: Rect);   // ADR 0017: resize, clamped+visible
}
impl View for ListBox {
    // focusable; arrows/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End move, scrolls to keep selection in view.
    // No longer owns a ScrollBar (ADR 0015): reports scroll_metrics/accepts
    // set_scroll instead — see Behaviour below.
    fn scroll_metrics(&self) -> Option<ScrollMetrics>;   // vertical axis only
    fn set_scroll(&mut self, offset: Point);             // sets `top`, clamped
    fn set_bounds(&mut self, bounds: Rect);              // delegates to the inherent method above (ADR 0017)
}
```

## Behaviour & invariants

- **Label.** Not focusable; draws its text in its style, clipped. (TurboVision's
  hot-key→link focus transfer needs view IDs — deferred.)
- **Button.** Focusable. `Enter` or `Space` posts `command` (enabled-gated by
  `Context`, ADR 0003) and consumes the key. A *default* button's command is what
  the dialog posts on `Enter` from elsewhere (the dialog asks each button
  `is_default`). Draws filled in `ButtonFocused` when focused, else `ButtonNormal`,
  with the label centred (`[ Label ]`-ish). A disabled command never fires.
- **InputLine.** Focusable. Holds a `String` and a grapheme cursor index. Printable
  `Char` inserts at the cursor; `Backspace`/`Delete` remove the grapheme
  before/at it; `Left`/`Right`/`Home`/`End` move by grapheme; horizontal scroll
  keeps the cursor visible in a field narrower than the text. Draws the caret (a
  reverse cell) only when focused. Editing goes through grapheme-aware ops
  (`unicode-segmentation`, ADR 0006) — no byte indexing.
- **CheckBox.** Focusable; `Space`/`Enter` toggles `checked`. Draws `[X]`/`[ ]` +
  label. **RadioButtons.** Focusable; `Up`/`Down` move the selection; draws
  `(•)`/`( )` per option; exactly one selected.
- **ListBox.** Focusable; `Up`/`Down` move the selection by one, `PgUp`/`PgDn` by a
  page, `Home`/`End` to the ends; `top` scrolls so the selection is always visible;
  the selected row draws in `Selection`. An empty list has `selected() == None`.
  **Scroll chrome (ADR 0015):** `ListBox` no longer builds, draws, or
  hit-tests its own `ScrollBar` — it reports `scroll_metrics()` as
  `Some(ScrollMetrics { vertical: Some(AxisMetrics { total: items.len(),
  visible: rows(), pos: top }), horizontal: None })` whenever it has more
  rows than fit, `None` otherwise, and accepts `set_scroll(Point { y, .. })`
  by clamping `y` into `0..=items.len().saturating_sub(rows())` and setting
  `top` (not moving the selection — the same "pan without selecting" the old
  wheel/bar handling already had). A `ListBox` used with no delegating owner
  is left with **no fallback scroll bar of its own** — the one production
  call site ([`FileDialog`](window.md)) gains a host, so this has no live
  consequence today, but it is a real trade-off for a bare future use (see
  ADR 0015's Consequences). The wheel (`ScrollUp`/`ScrollDown`) still pans
  `top` directly inside `ListBox`'s own `handle_event` — only the *bar*
  (build/draw/hit-test) moves to the host.
  **Resize (ADR 0017):** `set_bounds` updates the stored bounds, clamps `top`
  to what the new height can show, then re-runs the same "keep the selection
  visible" logic `move_by`/`select` already use — exercised by
  [`HelpWindow`](help_window.md)'s resizable topic-list column.
- All controls clip to their canvas (ADR 0008) and degrade without panic for tiny
  bounds and empty content.

## Collaborators

- `Canvas`/`Buffer`, `geometry`, `cell::Cell`, `theme::{Role, Theme}`, `color::Style`.
- `view::{View, Group, Context}`, `command::{Command, CommandSet}`, `event` types.
- `unicode-segmentation` for grapheme navigation in `InputLine` (shared with the
  editor's text model).
- Controls never reference one another: they post via `Context`; a `Window`'s
  `Group` interior routes and lays them out.

## Test plan (write these first)

- **Logic:** button command/default accessors; input-line insert/delete/cursor
  moves and scroll; checkbox toggle; radio selection wrap; list selection +
  scroll-to-keep-visible; grapheme handling for a wide/combining char in the input.
  `ListBox::scroll_metrics` is `None` under a page, `Some` with the right
  `total`/`visible`/`pos` once it overflows; `set_scroll` clamps and moves
  `top` without touching `selected`.
- **Render (snapshot):** focused vs unfocused button; an input line with caret;
  checkbox checked/unchecked; radio group; a list with a selection scrolled
  (no bar of its own — rendered bare; a hosted snapshot lives in
  [`window.md`](window.md)'s test plan).
- **Interaction (scripted events):** button posts on Enter/Space, disabled does
  not; tab moves the focus flag (in `Group`); list arrows scroll; the wheel
  still scrolls a bare `ListBox` directly.
- **Manual:** the `dialogs` example (Phase 5) on a real terminal.

## Open questions

- Hot-key underline markup (`~X~`) and Label→control focus links: need view IDs;
  deferred (same family as `view.md`'s ID deferral).
- Per-dialog command disabling (greying an OK button until valid) — see
  [`window.md`](window.md) open questions.
