//! UI commands and their enabled/disabled state (ADR 0003, 0004).
//!
//! A [`Command`] is the integer id of an action — TurboVision's `cmXxx`. A view
//! posts one when, say, its button is pressed; the command then bubbles up the
//! owner chain to whoever handles it (`view::Group`). This module owns only the
//! *vocabulary* and the [`CommandSet`] that says which commands are live right
//! now, so a disabled command never fires and a control can grey itself.
